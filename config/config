# INPUT FOR ALL STEPS
# ----- Genome information -----
genome1=""     #full path to either an assembly containing both haplotypes, or an assembly containing one of two haplotypes. Assemblies can be compressed (.gz) or not.
genome2=""     #full path to the second haplotypes (optional)
haplotype1=""  #name1 [name of haplotype1 - will be used to rename the genome and the contigs inside the genome]
haplotype2=""  #name2 [name of haplotype2 - will be used to rename the genome and the contigs inside the genome] (optional)

# ----- Ancestral reference (optional) -----
ancestral_genome="" #full path to the ancestral genome to be used whenever possible
ancestral_gff=""   #full path to the associated gff to be used whehever possible

# ----- Identification of the region of interest -----
scaffold="" #full path to a 3 columns tab separated file containing information on scaffolds of interest (sex chromosomes or mating-type chromosomes) for plotting.
# from first to last column: genome name, scaffold name, a string ("normal" or "reversed") stating wether the scaffold orientation should be reversed

# ----- Already produced TE and gene annotation -----
# if step I is not performed or annotateTE is set to "NO", then TE can be provided in fasta format (optional):
#TEgenome1="" #full path to the bed of TE for genome1
#TEgenome2="" #full path to the bed of TE for genome2
#TEancestral="" #full path to the bed of TE for the ancestral genome

# if step I is not performed or annotate is set to "NO", then gtf must be provided: 
gtf1="" #full path to gtf for genome1
gtf2="" #full path to gtf for genome2

#_________________
# INPUT FOR STEP I: Gene annotation and TE prediction
# ----- TE prediction -----
#annotateTE="" #a string (YES/NO) stating whether TE prediction should be performed

# if annotateTE="YES" then the following options are required
ncbi_species="" #NCBI species name
TEdatabase="" #a full path to a custom database of TE from related species (optional)
removeTE="YES" #a string (YES/NO) stating wether gene covered at >99% by TE should be removed

# ----- Gene annotation -----
annotate="" #a string (YES/NO) stating whether annotation of the genomes should be performed

# if annotate="YES" then the following options are required
fungus="" #a string (YES/NO) stating whether species is a fungus
orthoDBspecies="" #one of : "Metazoa" "Vertebrata" "Viridiplantae" "Arthropoda" "Eukaryota" "Fungi" "Alveolata"
RelatedProt="" #full path to custom database of protein data from related species in fasta format (optional)
rnaseq="" #a string (YES/NO) stating whether RNAseq data is available for use in annotation
busco_lineage="" #name of the busco lineage corresponding to your genome, available lineages are available with 'busco --list-dataset'
interpro="NO" #a string (YES/NO) stating whether interproscan should be ran for quality check, WARNING: it can take several days for big dataset

# if rnaseq="YES", path to RNAseq data must be provided in a text file: 
RNAseqlist="" #full path to a list of raw rnaseq data 
# In case RNAseq data is already aligned, bam file can be provided instead:
bamlist1="" #full path to a list of bam on genome1
bamlist2="" #full path to a list of bam on genome2
